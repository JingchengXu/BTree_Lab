I write a script for you to help you visualize my B+ Tree
Just type in
./test.sh cachesize keysize valuesize insert_time

To print out the tree.
I add two sentences in Print and calls the display function.
This will help you diplay my tree in a normal way.

In our sanitycheck function.
We implement the following function
1.Check if the keys are properly sorted.
2.Check if the keys on the interior are nonexist.
3.Check if there is missing key in the Leaf Node.
4.Check if the leaf node key is missing any associated value.

In our Update funcion 
We can update a value according to its key.

Insert is a much more complicated process just look at my code and run the test_me.

Thanks
